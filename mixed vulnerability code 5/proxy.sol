//In this example, the Proxy contract uses delegatecall to forward any call 
//it receives to an address provided by the user. The Target contract contains a call 
//to the pwn() function that changes the owner of the contract to the caller.

//The Attack contract takes advantage of this setup by calling the forward function of the Proxy contract, 
//passing the address of the Target contract and the encoded function call pwn(). 
//This results in the Proxy contract's storage being modified, specifically the owner variable,
// which is set to the attackerâ€™s address.
